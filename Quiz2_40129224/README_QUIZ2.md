all the features that are done in this code:
- full tennis court with textures
- 4 letters A, R, U, B
- 2 rackets
- sky box
- 4 camera :
  -   default
  -   racket 1
  -   racket 2
  -   roatating on the y-axis
-   spotlight on the z-axis
-   shadow with 2 pass shadow algorithms
<br>
<br>


input :
- escap = close window
<br>

- space = random position
<br>

- shift + up = + z-axis
- shift + down = - z-axis
- up = + y-axis
- down = - y-axis
- left = - x-axis
- right = + x-axis
<br>

- shift + w = model to up
- shift + s = model to down
- shift + d = model to right
- shift + a = model to left
<br>

- d = rotate on y-axis to anti-clockwise
- a = rotate on y-axis to clockwise
- w = rotate on x-axis to clockwise
- s = rotate on x-axis to anti-clockwise
- z = rotate on z-axis to anti-clockwise
- c = rotate on z-axis to clockwise
<br>

- t = fill
- l = line
- p = point
<br>

- u = bigger
- j = smaller
<br>

- g = on/off rotating light
<br>

- b = on/off shadows
<br>

- r = model to origine
<br>

- i = on/off spotlight
<br>

- m = change different camera
<br>
  
- 1 = racket 1
- 2 = racket 2
