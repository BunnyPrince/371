all the features that are done in this code:
- Create a spherical tennis ball. (Use triangle mesh representations)
- Illuminate the scene by adding a point light source (white) 30 units above the mesh
  using the Phong model
- Render the scene with shadows using two pass shadow algorithm. (Key B to toggle)
- Make the racket movements possible
- Make the mesh turn right or left by a small amount
- two pass shadow algorithm.
- green texture on the ball and glossy finish (color of your choice) for the racket structure. (Key X for toggling)

Missing/didn't know how to do:
- Render the scene with clay texture on the ground mesh
- two pass shadow algorithm. (Key B to toggle)


Bonnus:
- make the light rotate
