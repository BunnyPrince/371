all the features that are done in this code:
- Create a spherical tennis ball. (Use triangle mesh representations)
- Illuminate the scene by adding a point light source (white) 30 units above the mesh
  using the Phong model
- Render the scene with shadows using two pass shadow algorithm. (Key B to toggle)
- Make the racket movements possible
- Make the mesh turn right or left by a small amount
- two pass shadow algorithm  (Key B to toggle).
- green texture on the ball and glossy finish (color of your choice) for the racket structure. (Key X for toggling)


Bonnus:
- make the light rotate


Inputs:
- right = camera to right
- lefft = camera to left
- up = camerao to up
- down  = camera to down
<br>

- shift + up = zoom
- shift + down = un-zoom
<br>

- escap = close window
<br>

- space = random position
<br>

- shift + w = model to up
- shift + s = model to down
- shift + d = model to right
- shift + a = model to left
<br>

- d = rotate on y-axis to anti-clockwise
- a = rotate on y-axis to clockwise
- w = rotate on x-axis to clockwise
- s = rotate on x-axis to anti-clockwise
- z = rotate on z-axis to anti-clockwise
- c = rotate on z-axis to clockwise
<br>

- t = fill
- l = line
- p = point
<br>

- u = bigger
- j = smaller
<br>

- g = on/off rotating light
<br>

- b = on/off shadows
<br>

- o = model to origine
<br>

- h = on/off glossy
<br>

- 1 = lower arm
- 2 = upper arm
